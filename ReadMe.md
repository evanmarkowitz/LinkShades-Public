## Link Shades App

* Due to this being a production app, I have posted snippets of the code to this public repository.

### Description

I built the The Link Shades App for an exisiting business.  The Link Shades app controls Smart Wifi Connected Window Shades with their Smart Phones.  Users are able to move their Window Shade up and Down in real time and create a daily schedule for their Shade.  Websockets allow a user to see the exact position of their Shade at all time.  The login process includes Authentication, as well as each user command.

### Successes

I found working in React Native very fulfilling.  I also enjoyed working with Websockets.  For an app like this, where two way communcation is essential, Webosckets seem like the easiest and best technology to implement.

### Difficulties 
This was the first time I worked on a legacy codebase.  I was tasked with migrating a PWA to a React Native App.  A large hurdle was the lack of documentation and identifying what communication the server was expecting through Websockets was hard.

### Tech Stack
* React Native
* React-Navigation
* Websockets
* Redux
